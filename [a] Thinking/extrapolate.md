# Extrapolative Thinking


[A Treatise On Ingenuity]()
-
The aim of the ensuing Treatise is to present a novel categorization of thought, which I have termed Extrapolative Thinking. It is the endeavor of this work to coalesce a plethora of abstract methods of thought which include but are not limited to those such as Axiomatic Thinking, Critical Thinking, ... also served in large by intrinsic implicit thought. An example presented by Socrates which we know as the "Socratic Method". Which was founded upon the thought that people possess the truth within themselves. According to Socrates you need only to ask the correct series of questions in order to draw out that truth from a person. Extrapolative Thinking assumes a comparable standpoint that after the axioms of a given subject are presented no further knowledge needed be given. Through the questioning of the self followed by experimentation one is able to build their intuitive thinking skills. It is the natural proclivity of a individual with strong intuition to express implicit knowledge in a more instinctive manner.
