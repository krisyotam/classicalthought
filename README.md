## Classical Thought

Classical Thought is a project I started with intentions of later adding to my mathematics [curricula](). This project intends to do something about a fundamental issue in society
**learning**. I will attempt to deal with this issue by introducing what I call Classical Thinking which is redifining the fundamental skills
most important to learning. That being reading, writing, speaking, and thinking. 

The goal here is to examine the modern frameworks for teaching **reading**, **writing**, **thinking**, and **speaking**. To understand the fundamental flaws in these systems, and then to reconstruct them. 
We will work on each of these skill's independantly and together. 

Here I will guide you to the excercises I will use to refine my own ability. It is not meant to do any of the work for you but rather tell you the beasts you should slay. It is in slaying these beasts you will reap
the reward of refinement in ability. 

#### What is this?
- A guide to improving reading, writing, thinking, and speaking
- A platform for reconstructing modern educational frameworks, critically examining their shortcomings, and offering alternative approaches based on timeless principles.
- A project aimed at fostering self-directed learning, encouraging individuals to think critically, express themselves clearly, and engage more deeply with the world around them.
- A resource that seeks to bridge ancient wisdom with modern educational practices, blending rigorous analytical thinking with creative problem-solving.

#### What this isn't.
- This is **not** a rigid, one-size-fits-all curriculum or a set of prescribed lessons to follow blindly. It encourages active engagement, not passive consumption.
- It is **not** a critique of the modern education system for the sake of criticism, but a constructive effort to offer viable alternatives.
- This project is **not** limited to only theoretical discussions; it aims to provide **practical exercises and strategies** that can be implemented in real-world contexts.
- It is **not** exclusive to a single field of study or a particular age group—it is meant to be accessible and useful for anyone seeking to improve their intellectual and communicative abilities.
